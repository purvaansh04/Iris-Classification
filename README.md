# Iris-Classification
# Iris Classification using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project for classifying Iris flowers into different species using Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.

## Overview

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning. It contains 150 samples of Iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify the species of Iris flowers based on these features. This dataset is already pre-exiting in scikit-learn library

## Features

- Python: Programming language used for development.
- scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- TensorFlow: Deep learning library used for building neural networks.
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment used for development and experimentation.
- Iris Dataset: The dataset used for training and testing the machine learning model(dataset is already pre-exiting in scikit-learn library).
